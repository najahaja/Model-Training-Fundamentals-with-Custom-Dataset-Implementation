# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction - Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements a **complete ML pipeline** for predicting housing prices, covering:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training & evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## 📊 Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing value handling (`SimpleImputer`)  
   - Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`)  

✅ **Feature Engineering**  
   - Polynomial feature expansion (`PolynomialFeatures`)  

✅ **Models Implemented**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - SGD Regressor  
   - Ridge & Lasso Regression  
   - Logistic Regression (for classification)  

✅ **Evaluation**  
   - Learning curves  
   - Hyperparameter tuning (`GridSearchCV`)  
   - Comparative analysis (RMSE, R², Accuracy, F1-Score)
